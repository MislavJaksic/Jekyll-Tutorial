## [Layouts](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/step-by-step/04-layouts/)

Jekyll supports `Markdown` and `HTML`.  

Create `about.md`.  

### Creating a layout

Layouts in `_layouts` are templates that wrap around your content.  
Layouts can be nested!  

Create `_layouts/default.html`.  

`content` is a special variable that carries the value of the calling page.  

The content page has to say which layout it wants to use.
